# NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, or religion.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of behavior not in line with this code of conduct may be reported to The Office of Science and Technology's Assessment and Monitoring Division Director, Patrick Lynch. Reports can be made either by emailing [patrick.lynch@noaa.gov](mailto:patrick.lynch@noaa.gov) or using [this form](https://forms.gle/iNnmZFS9vwy29gb49), which includes an option to report anonymously.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly by the community leader(s). The community leader(s) will take action that may include warning the offender or asking them to leave an event or an online channel either temporarily or permanently, or seeking help from law enforcement. In addition, the community leader(s) may suggest using existing [NOAA support and reporting processes](#noaa-support-and-reporting-processes).

### NOAA support and reporting processes

**If you experience discrimination**, the EEO counseling and complaints process may be appropriate. Employees (current/former), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps Officers and Public Health Service, contractors, or applicants for employment who believe that they have been discriminated against or retaliated against may contact the NOAA Office of Civil Rights (OCR). Learn more at [https://www.noaa.gov/civil-rights/eeo-counseling-complaints](https://www.noaa.gov/civil-rights/eeo-counseling-complaints).

**If you experience harassment (including but not limited to sexual harassment)** and are a NOAA employee, affiliate, or contractor, it can be reported to NOAA's Office of Human Capital Services (OHCS) Workforce Relations Division (WRD) 955 Program Office at DAO-955.OHCS@noaa.gov. This "955 Process" is distinct from EEO complaints because it offers an expedited review and aims to terminate incidents and take disciplinary action. Reporting is protected from retaliation. Learn more at [https://www.noaa.gov/ohcs-955-and-sash](https://www.noaa.gov/ohcs-955-and-sash) and [https://www.noaa.gov/civil-rights/sexual-harassment](https://www.noaa.gov/civil-rights/sexual-harassment).

**If you experience sexual assault or sexual harassment (SASH)** and are a NOAA employee, affiliate, or contractor, contact the [NOAA Workplace Violence Prevention and Response Program (WVPR)](https://www.noaa.gov/workplace-violence-prevention-response-program) for comprehensive services. Additional guidance is in [NAO 202-1106](https://www.noaa.gov/organization/administration/nao-202-1106-noaa-sexual-assault-and-sexual-harassment-prevention-and). WVPR staff can provide information on reporting, victim advocacy, and resources. Confidential consultation or restricted reporting is available via a WVPR Regional Coordinator at noaa.victimservices@noaa.gov. Support is also available 24/7 through the SASH Helpline (RAINN) at 1-866-288-6558 or [http://NOAASASHHelpline.org/](http://NOAASASHHelpline.org/).
